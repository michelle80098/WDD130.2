    <h2>Michelle Huang</h2>
    <p>My name is Michelle Huang. I was born and raised in Lynnwood, Washington. I am the middle child of 5 siblings. I am studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Machine Learning and a minor in Automotive Technology. I hope to become a test engineer for the automotive field one day, hence the automotive minor. Since this is my second to last semester before obtaining my bachelors degree, I have been considering continuing my education in a masters degree in electrical engineering after graduation. Some hobbies of mine includes traveling, trying new foods, hot yoga, learning new recipes, board games (recently learned how to play catan and project L and I am obsessed!), doing my own nails, and learning about investments, etc.</p>  

    <p>I am very excited to learn from this course. There are endless opportunities in the field for web design, knowing the basics can not only build my skill section on my resume, but I have noticed that my peers has used this skill to build their own websites for their side businesses. I have been a member of the church my whole life, and have been blessed to be surrounded with wonderful faithful saints that inspired me to keep improving myself. One of my favorite things about BYU-Idaho is the faculty and peers, I have never felt more safe and loved! Everyone is so kind, loving, and is always willing to help each other.
